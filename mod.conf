description = With these chests, you can access your bags and craft inventory with one click and move items between bag and chest. Other buttons speed up inventory movement even more: "DA": drop all from the selected inventory to the chest, "TA": take all from the chest and move it to your selected inventory, "SA": swap all items between chest and selected inventory and "FA": filter all - drop those items form your selected inventory to the chest of which there is already at least one in the chest. If the place where the chest stands is protected, everyone who can build there can access the chest (shared chest). You can also set a description text for the chests. Interaction with tubes is possible.
